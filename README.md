# CodeCademy Reddit Client Portfolio Project

This project utilizes Redux Toolkit and Create-React-App. Also, the freely available Reddit API, by adding .json to the end of the URL.
This page loads the most popular Reddit posts and allows users to access the likes, comments, and a share link. Adding a comment will open an alert showing the comment that would `POST`. 

Users can also see an alert when clicking the SHARE button with access to a shareable URL they can copy and paste.
